            <p>Hi, I'm Maia. I really like doing graphic design. I think it's super fun. I also like to eat frozen mango that has thawed out a bit. I'm eating as I'm typing this right now.</p>

            <p>I also really like going swimming in the summer. I have kind of developed a slight fear of the water, so thats unfortunate. But I still swim so it's fine.</p>
